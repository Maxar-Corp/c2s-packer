1. Clone c2s-packer into your desired install location.
   git clone https://github.com/radiantbluetechnologies/c2s-packer
2. Edit your .bashrc (or .cshrc) file and add GOPATH to your environment:
   For bash: export GOPATH=<install location>
   i.e. I cloned in /home/mkrutz and there is now a c2s-packer directory, so
        I would do: export GOPATH=/home/mkrutz/c2s-packer in my .bashrc.
3. This build process requires the golang rpm package to be installed. If it is
   not installed do a 'sudo rpm install golang'
4. Also add $GOPATH/bin to your $PATH environment variable
5. cd <install-location>/c2s-packer
6. Run the buildAll.sh script
7. When the script finishes, your c2s usable packer executable will be in there
   $GOPATH/bin directory.

NOTE: This packer executable is NOT for use in the UNCLASSIFIED AWS environment!!!
